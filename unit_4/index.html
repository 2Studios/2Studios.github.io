 	<h3>Our Mission is to Facilitate an Environment that Creatively Instills Self-Esteem and Confidence in Children of All Ages Through their Participation in Sports and Play.</h3>

	<p><em>Since 1999:</em> Powerplay has offered unique mix of activites and special events to children in Park Slope and surrounding communities. Contrary to many preschool gymnastics programs, our primary goal is not only to teach gymnastics skills but to utilize them as tools for teaching life success skills.
	We believe children learn best in a supportive environment which allows them to, <br><em>Explore, Discover and Play!</em></p>
